[![Rust workflow](https://github.com/rellfy/openai/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rellfy/openai/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

An unofficial Rust library for the OpenAI API.

## Core Principles

- Modularity
- Environmental variables should be the prioritized method of authentication,
  but not the only way to do things
- Library, not a wrapper
- Idiomatic Rust

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `examples` directory.

As the package is still a work in progress and there may be breaking changes,
examples are not available for all the crate's functionality.

Currently, there are examples for the `completions` module and the `chat` module.
For other modules, refer to the `tests` submodules for some reference.
